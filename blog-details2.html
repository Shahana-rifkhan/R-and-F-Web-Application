                           At its very basic, matching your clothes can be watered down to simply matching colors. You'll have to master this before you can achieve any other feat with your clothes. To start out, you should match like-colored shirts and pants. For example, if you have an green shirt, you can match it by wearing green pants.Please keep in mind that this needs to be the exact color. If your shirt is olive green, then your pants should be as well. Matching two different colors, even if they're in the same general color group, is a guaranteed failure.

                           <h5>Contrast is Key</h5>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Now that you've graduated from grade school, it's time to kick your matching know-how up a notch. One of the greatest things about knowing how to match like colors is knowing how to make them contrast with each other.

                           Of course, this is more than likely to blow your mind at the start. After all, we are talking about the importance of matching, and wearing two different colors isn't matching at all...is it?

                           It is, but only if you do it right.

                           Contrasting colors means more than just picking two different shades and throwing them on. When you contrast, you have to keep in mind a simple rule: opposites attract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           If you're wearing a light top (and we do mean light, not bright), you'll want to contrast it by wearing darker pants. For example, if you're wearing a white shirt, your best bet it to wear a pair of brown pants.

                           On the other hand, if you want to wear a darker top (such as a dark blue shirt), you could opt for a lighter pair of pants (like a pair of khaki colored pants).

                           The right set of two-toned colors is bound to set you off on the right path and have you looking impressive - and it doesn't even take much effort to do it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <h5>Check Your Patterns</h5>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Majority of the shirts and pants that are sold have some sort of pattern or design that goes along with it. That means you not only have to match the colors, but the patterns have to work as well.

                           Let's have a look at plaid garments. Plaid garments have a way of being busy all on their own. A good busy, sure, but busy nonetheless. Wearing too much of it will only serve to make you look like a checker board.

                           If you're wearing a plaid top, make sure to match it by wearing something much more simple for your pants. A solid color will most certainly do the trick, and as a bonus, you'll draw the people's eyes right to your shirt.

                           The same applies if you're wearing plaid pants. A simple, solid shirt is all you need to attract the eyes to your, erm, bottom (if you're comfortable with that sort of thing).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Another very popular pattern is the striped pattern. Unlike the checked pattern, you won't look like a complete fool if you wear striped pants and shirts - provided you wear them properly.

                           Make sure that the stripes you're wearing go in the same direction. If your shirt has vertical stripes, so should your pants. If you're wearing a top with diagonal strips, then your pants should be going in the same exact direction.

                           Also, make sure that your top and bottom stripes are the same color and width. This will make it seem as if they were bought together, and help you pull of the look successfully.

                           And for the sake of all things holy, please don't wear horizontal stripes. You'll instantly look like someone from a 1920's chain gang. Avoid this at all costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <h5>Match It to Your Skin Tone</h5>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           It's important to remember that certain skin tones bring out an outfit better than others. No, your clothes aren't being racist: some clothing just "pops" better when it's added to a particular skin tone, and you can use this to your advantage.

                           For those who have fair skin, you would do well to match it with lighter colors. These colors would help to complement your complexion and make you look even better.

                           Try sticking with light blue, light grey, or even a mild pink, and couple it with a blue or black bottom to give of a light-hearted and poppy look.

                           Those that have darker skin tone should go with a more deeper color. We recommend khaki, brown, grey, and navy blue as some examples to try, as they'll emphasize your complexion and make you look quite dashing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Make sure your pants are of a darker hue as well, and that they are a healthy contrast to the color of the shirt you chose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <h5>White and Black Go with (Almost) Everything</h5>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           If all else fails, there is no fallback quite like the classic black and white.

                           From a scientific standpoint, one is the presence of all color, and the other is the absence of all color. To us, that just means they can go with anything.

                           There really is virtually no limit to what you can do with black and white. Even the strangest patterns and cuts can somehow work when you place them with an all black or all white garment to match.

                           Have a pair of burgundy pants you've been dying to wear but can't seem to make work? Throw on a white or black top and your good to go.

                           Have a really neat t-shirt design that doesn't match anything in your wardrobe? It can if you're wearing back or white pants.

                           Heck, you can even go so far as to wear a white top and black bottom, or a black top and white bottom, and it will still work.

                           There's really only one exception to this rule: don't wear white on white, or black on black.

                           Ironically, wearing an all-white or all-black outfit rarely works out well. For all their abilities to mix with any color, it turns out their worst enemy is themselves.

                           Wearing a black top and bottom automatically makes you look like you're going to a funeral, and wearing a white pants and shirt make it seem as if you're going to church to get baptized - and we're quite certain that's not what you want.

                           In the end, fashion is something that should be taken seriously. The wrong wear could easily make you look ridiculous, but when you take the time out to match up your outfit properly, you show to the world that you're someone to notice.

                           We don't see anything wrong with that.
